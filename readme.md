# AIML Project

Welcome to the **AIML Project** repository!

This project is aimed at applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. While the long-term goal is to incorporate multiple datasets and expand into machine learning, the current focus is on a single project that emphasizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to identify patterns and trends.
